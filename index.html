    <p>
        For some reason, managing SSL certs is still a pain in the year 2023. Certmaster fixes that
        with the first open-source tool that automates isuing certs <i>and installing
            to destinations</i>.
    </p>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>HTTP validation doesn't work behind a load balancer.</li>
        <li>DNS validation by hand is extremely tedious.</li>
        <li>Once you have the cert, you still need to manually upload it to
            servers or LBs.</li>
        <li>Web hosts make you to use <i>their</i> DNS if you want automatic
            cert renewal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This project, <a href="https://www.github.com/poundifdef/certmaster" target="_blank">poundifdef/certmaster</a>,
            is the
            first
            tool that uses DNS to automatically validate certificates and upload to destinations.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.certmaster.dev">https://www.certmaster.dev</a>, in beta,
            offers a paid service for managing certs and renewal.</li>
        <li>Certmaster supports 100+ DNS providers due to the excellent
            <a href="https://github.com/go-acme/lego" target="_blank">go-acme/lego</a>
            library and a growing list of destinations.
    </ul>

    <h2>Interested?</h2>

        <li><strong>Code:</strong> It is easy to add new destinations.
            We want to support as many as possible. Github issues and stars help
            too.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Preorder:</strong> I'm validating whether this service
            will be commercially viable and plan to launch in February 2024.
            A <b><a href="https://buy.stripe.com/7sIbK6cRYbRI2ti144" target="_blank">$10 preorder</a></b>
            would go a long way towards proving there is
            customer interest.
